# 🚗 EV Sales Prediction – AICTE EduNet Internship Project

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze and predict the global growth of **Electric Vehicle (EV) sales** using historical data.  
As EV adoption accelerates worldwide, understanding regional trends and annual sales growth helps policymakers, manufacturers, and researchers plan for a sustainable future in electric mobility.

## 📊 Objective
To clean, analyze, and visualize EV sales data and identify key growth patterns and top-performing regions.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning (upcoming in next modules)

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from the **IEA Global EV Data** (International Energy Agency), containing country-wise and yearly EV sales, stock, and powertrain data.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Global EV sales show an exponential rise after 2018.
- China and Europe dominate global EV markets.
- Strong positive correlation between year and EV adoption.

## 📸 Visualizations
All generated charts are saved in the `/images` folder:
- `ev_sales_trend.png` – EV Sales Over the Years  
- `top_regions.png` – Top 5 Regions by Total EV Sales  
- `heatmap.png` – Correlation Heatmap

## 📘 About the Project
This project is part of the **AICTE EduNet Internship Program (Electric Vehicle Theme)**.  
It demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visual storytelling using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
